Earnest Agriculture,earnest.ag,Written Down,IndieBio,Rantoul,United States,"To feed a global population of 9.7 billion people by 2050, farmers need to produce 50% more calories than they do today. However, large-scale farms rely on synthetic fertilizers, which degrade their soil and release more CO2 emissions than global aviation and shipping combined.  

Earnest Agriculture has designed a microbial consortium that improves nutrient use, plant resilience, a disease protection while improving soil health. Applied as a seed coating, it’s a triple whammy that can boost yields by 6%, reduce synthetic chemical use, and make crops more resilient to climate change. Earnest sources its patented microbes from natural prairies and uses a machine learning algorithm to formulate a microbe consortium that works in diverse climates and soil conditions. By focusing on the $570 billion livestock feed market first and crops for human consumption second, Earnest will minimize regulatory friction and get to market faster. 

The grandchildren of farmers, co-founders Gabe Price, PhD, and Eddy Mejia launched Earnest in 2019.

BioMetallica has developed the first eco-friendly biotechnology for recovering palladium, platinum, and rhodium at room temperature, with zero wastewater, at a competitive cost.

Clean energy technologies, such as wind energy, solar energy, and electric vehicles require two to five times as much copper as their traditional counterparts. Copper, however, is expected to be in short supply due to the high costs associated with the mining, concentrating, and processing of copper ore. Currently, copper faces supply chain limitations, as 80% of copper is produced by smelting, which is environmentally damaging, highly regulated, fossil fuel dependent, and high in capital costs. Due to these reasons, the majority of smelting is carried out in China, meaning that copper concentrate is shipped globally from mine sites to be processed in China, and refined copper is then shipped to where it is needed for use - a costly and energy-intensive supply chain, leaving the US without a geopolitically secure supply of this critical mineral. Still Bright is revolutionizing copper production with a patented electrochemical process that can replace smelting with a more efficient and sustainable alternative.

SWAP robotics addresses two significant cost challenges to the CapEx and OpEx of solar farms with automated solutions. In the utility-scale solar construction phase, SWAP is focused on the single biggest labor expense: solar panel laying. In the following 30-year Operations & Maintenance phase, they also solve the single biggest expense: cutting the grass & vegetation on 1,000+ acre sites. Each of these activities cost over $10 million throughout the lifetime of a typical utility-scale solar site. Their robots for solar panel laying and vegetation management at large solar farms drastically reduce install costs and continuing O&M. SWAP already has dozens of robots deployed already on half a dozen solar sites, and are on-track for over $3M of revenue in 2024. Solar additions will be 58% of new electricity generation in USA this year, and utility-scale solar is typically a site bigger than 500 acres in size, and 80% of new solar energy in USA coming online is from utility-scale solar.

Unicorn Biotechnologies,unicornb.io,Operating,HAX,Sheffield,United Kingdom,"Unicorn Biotechnologies is accelerating science & technology to power the rapidly growing, trillion-dollar bioeconomy. Mammalian cells are the building blocks for transformative markets. From extending human healthspan and combating ageing itself (longevity) to creating potentially curative cancer treatments (cell & gene therapies), growing replacement tissues and organs (regenerative medicine) and developing new food sources to feed a growing population (cultivated meat), mammalian cells provide potential solutions to all of these challenges. However, the process of growing mammalian cells hasn’t significantly changed since the 1950s. Non-industrial production methods are highly manual and labor intensive, and remain artisinal in nature. This slows down the pace of R&D and creates significant barriers to scaling breakthrough innovations like potential cures and new protein sources to nourish people. Non-robust processes with high batch failure rates and multi-year tech transfers can mean a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a therapeutic intervention for a single person. Unicorn is solving these challenges by developing a platform to industrialize the production of mammalian cells and seamlessly scale processes from benchtop to commercial production. They leverage advanced industrial control, fluidics, biochemical-based sensing and artificial intelligence-driven adaptive process control systems to create machines that reduce labor (80%+), variability (50%+) and production costs (25-50%+) of manufacturing mammalian cells.

Melanin is a Multifunctional Super Material with UV Blocking, Radiation blocking, electrical and semiconductor properties. A detailed presentation is attached.  

The applications of Melanin and its properties were always known. But the main constraint for its commercial use was the availability of technology to produce it in sufficient quantities and at an affordable price. Our technology solves this problem.

As our first use case of melanin, we have been successful to produce a prototype of sunscreen  with SPF 30 using  melanin as a UV blocker and without using any existing chemical or Mineral UV blockers in the formulation .

As you might be  aware, chemicals and nano Minerals are damaging the Corral Reefs and the Marine life they sustain . Toxicity of these chemicals on the human body and the marine ecosystem  is also a cause of concern inviting scrutiny from USFDA . Customers and the 12 billion dollar sunscreen  Industry are looking for an environmentally friendly , reef safe , non toxic and effective UV blocking solution for sun screens .

This was to not only an effort to address the challenges of typical users needing secure access to digital and physical assets, but also to provide accessible security for users challenged by language or physical limitations such as mobility or dyslexia. Our solution was to make the ""knowledge factor"" (typically a password) an interaction with a user-specified asset, e.g. their own biometric or other object that befits their capabilities.

Since then, we have been awarded relevant patents in the UK, US, EU, Japan and China and have patents pending in Korea and India. We have also begun pursuing another set of claims in the US originally filed by Mike Hill (founder) in 2011.

Zio Health,zio-health.com,Written Down,HAX,London,United Kingdom,"ZIO health's proprietary pocket-sized technology brings lab testing to the point of care to improve patient outcomes. Using ZiO's technology, we developed a therapeutic Drug Monitoring device - A powerful tool for dose individualisation to enhance drug efficacy. 

Our therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) device quantitatively tests medication levels at the point-of-care. Using machine learning algorithms, we combine the real-time test results with the patients’ unique profile to accurately provide dosing information. 

We are testing various medications with a narrow therapeutic range in which medications need to be tested daily due to the high risk of overdosing that leads to toxicity. 

ZiO Health's Vancomycin TDM POC Device:

Some medications like Vancomycin have a small difference between the minimum effective concentration and the minimum toxic concentration in the blood. 60% of the vancomycin doses are not in therapeutic range and ~20% of the doses are administered in the toxic range, leading to adverse drug effects i.e. nephrotoxitiy.

Current testing methods test for ‘total vancomycin’ levels, rather than the active form, free vancomycin, which leads to further inaccurate dosing. The dosing process today involves numerous inputs from various experts & uses expensive testing equipment – the vancomycin test alone costs over $100 per test. This cost increases due to the longer hospital stays due to inaccurate dosing leading to ineffective treatment. Current dosing models generalize everyone’s health profile based on the population rather than considering the patient’s unique profile.

ZiO Health’s therapeutic Drug Monitoring device tests free vancomycin levels at the point-of-care, significantly reducing the cost in the testing & dosing process, freeing up hospital resources & staff time, and finally, leading to a better outcome for patients’ due to the reduced adverse side effects & reduced length of hospital stay.",HAX101706,"Zio Health is based in London, United Kingdom.
